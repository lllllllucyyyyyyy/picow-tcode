# Pico W T-Code (work in progress)
## and general serial over gatt starting point, I guess.

This project is (or at least will be... //TODO: Separate code into byte-sized portions so it makes sense to idiots like yours truly) a decently-documented T-Code implementation for the pico w that works over bluetooth. The T code and Bluetooth sections will be separate, so that either one can be adapted into individual projects if desired.
